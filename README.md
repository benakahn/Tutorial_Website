# tutorial_website


Tutorial Website is a web based application that gives users the opportunity to go online and learn different courses and take quiz on that course and even he can do exercise on that course. The Education Website , has a centralized database to keep record off all the users as well as subscribers. There is a module for user can sign-up. There is also admin module where the system admin view prospective user details. This web-based system will be cost-effective and it will help the user to higher up their IQ level.
This project is implemented using : MySql for its database and php , HTML , CSS for the frontend.



Software Description
	XAMPP is a free and open source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of  the  Apache  HTTP  Server,  Maria  DB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages. XAMPP stands for Cross-Platform (X), Apache (A), Maria DB (M), PHP (P) and Perl (P). It is a simple, lightweight Apache distribution that makes it extremely easy for developers to create a local web server for testing and deployment purposes. Everything needed to setup a web server application (Apache), database (Maria DB), and scripting language (PHP) – is included  in an extract file.

3.2.1 MySQL (XAMPP):
	Is an open source relational database management system (RDBMS) which is integrated in the Xampp webserver .SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language used for managing relational databases and performing various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s, SQL is regularly used by database administrators, as well as by developers writing data integration scripts and data analysts looking to set up and run analytical queries.
3.3 Introduction to web
	Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires and  wireless  networks. The web clients make requests to web server. The web server receives the request, finds the resources and returns the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it  usually  sends some type of content to the client. The client uses web browser to send request to the server. The server often sends response to the browser with a set of instructions written in Hypertext  Markup Language (HTML). All browsers know how to display HTML page to the client.

3.3.1 HTML
	Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.HTML elements are represented by tags.HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.
3.3.2 JavaScript
	JavaScript (sometimes abbreviated JS) is a prototype-based scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed,  general purpose programming language and has first-class functions. It   is a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,  and  functional programming styles.
	JavaScript was formalized in the ECMA  Script language standard and  is primarily used  in the form of client-side JavaScript, implemented as part of a Web browser in order to provide enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites. This enables programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment. JavaScript's use in applications outside Web pages for example in PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets is also significant.
	In this application, JavaScript is used for validation purpose like  text  box  validation, email validation, phone number validation. JavaScript is the good tool for validating the web- applications.
Server Side JavaScript
	Meanwhile, Netscape also introduced the language for server-side scripting in Netscape Enterprise Server, first released in December, 1994.
3.3.3 XML
	Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification produced by the W3C, and several other related specifications, all gratis open standards.
	The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity,  generality,  and usability over the  Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for the languages of the world. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example in web services.
	Many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed  for  software developers to use to process XML data,  and several schema systems exist to aid in the definition   of XML-based languages. As of 2009, hundreds of XML- based languages have been developed, including RSS, Atom, SOAP, and XHTML.
	XML-based formats have become the default for many office-productivity tools, including Microsoft Office (Open Office) OpenOffice.org and Libre Office (Open Document),and Apple's iWork. XML has also been employed as the base language for communication protocols, such as XMPP.
3.3.4 MySQL
	MySQL ("My S-Q-L", officially "My Sequel") is the world's most used relational database management system (RDBMS) that runs as a server providing multi-user access to a number of databases. It is named after developer Michael Widenius daughter, my. The SQL phrase stands for Structured Query Language.
	The MySQL development project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU General Public License, as well as under a variety of proprietary agreements. MySQL was owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Swedish company MySQL AB, now owned  by Oracle Corporation. Free-software- open source projects that require a full featured database management system often use MySQL. For commercial use, several paid editions are available,  and offer additional functionality. Applications which use MySQL databases include: TYPO3, Joomla, Word Press, php BB, Drupal and other software built on the LAMP software  stack.  MySQL is also used in many high-profile, large-scale World Wide Web products, including Wikipedia, Google (though not for searches), Facebook, and Twitter.
Uses of MySQL
	MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications, and is a  central  component of the widely used LAMP open source web application software stack— LAMP is an acronym for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python".
